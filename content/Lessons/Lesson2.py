#%% Section 7 - Looping
#Two main types of loops: For loop, While loop
#For Loop - you know how many times to loop
#While Loop - you are checking a condition (loop with an IF stmt)
    #loop will run as long as condition is True

#%%% For Loop
#Slide 41    
numbers = [2, 5, 7, 9, 13, 25]

#Looping through a list
#Print the squares and cubes of these numbers really quickly
for num in numbers:
    print("-"*10)
    print(num)
    print("Square:",num ** 2) #square
    print("Cube:",num ** 3) #cube

#More efficient:
output = "X:{} Square:{} Cube:{}"
for num in numbers:
    print("-"*20)
    print(output.format(num, num**2, num**3))


#Looping "X" number of times
for i in range(5): #prints numbers 0, 1, 2, ... 4
    print(i)

for x in range(2,26,2): #range(start, end, skip)
    print(x) #prints 2, 4, 6, etc. stops at 24

#%%% List Comprehension
nums = [5, 7, 9, 12]
numsCube = [x**3 for x in nums]

#Faster than doing:
cubeList = []
for x in nums:
    cubeList.append(x**3)

#Can combine with IF Statements
nums = [3, 50, 29, 12, 100, 62]
squareList = [x**2 for x in nums if x > 50]

#%%% While Loops
#Slide 43
x = 5

#while x > 2:
#    print(x)
    #this is an infinite loop, it never stops
        # you can interrupt by hitting the Stop botton
        #OR hitting CTRL + C inside the console window
        
while x < 1000:
    print(x)        
    x += 1  #x = x + 1

#Careful with using floats in If statements or While loops
print(1.1 + 2.2 == 3.3) #Gives False
        #actually doing 3.30000001 or 3.29999999998...
print("{:.20f}".format(3.3))

round(1.1 + 2.2)  == round(3.3) #Gives True
